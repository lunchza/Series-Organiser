<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This is a small program that I wrote during my first year of study. Often I found my series folders to be a complete mess, with episodes out of order due to discrepancies in naming conventions by group uploaders. Initially the program was very limited, and a lot of testing was needed to make the algorithm robust. Now it handles a wide-variety of input formats.</p>

<p>Soon to be updated to version 2! All code has been rewritten from scratch and a whole bunch of new features will be added! [COMING SOON] </p>

<h3>Feature List</h3>

<ul>
<li>Quickly organise series on a season-by-season basis, forcing filenames to correspond to a format of your choosing</li>
<li>Dynamic preview let's you see the end result change as you edit the output format</li>
<li>Rollback feature</li>
<li>Context-menu integration[BETA/WIP]</li>
</ul><p>Change log</p>
