It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","tagline":"A small program to enforce filename consistency in downloaded series","body":"![image](http://i.imgur.com/ifNtS.png)\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\nThis is a small program that I wrote during my first year of study. Often I found my series folders to be a complete mess, with episodes out of order due to discrepancies in naming conventions by group uploaders. Initially the program was very limited, and a lot of testing was needed to make the algorithm robust. Now it handles a wide-variety of input formats.\r\n\r\nSoon to be updated to version 2! All code has been rewritten from scratch and a whole bunch of new features will be added! [COMING SOON] \r\n\r\n### Feature List\r\n\r\n* Quickly organise series on a season-by-season basis, forcing filenames to correspond to a format of your choosing\r\n* Dynamic preview let's you see the end result change as you edit the output format\r\n* Rollback feature\r\n* Context-menu integration[BETA/WIP]\r\n\r\nChange log\r\n\r\nv2.0\r\n-coming soon!\r\n\r\nv0.6b\r\n\r\n-Program renamed to Series Organiser\r\n\r\n-vastly improved support for anime by addressing common anime naming conventions\r\n\r\n-removed context-menu integration for now\r\n\r\n-minor bug fixes\r\n\r\nV0.53b\r\n\r\n-Added support for context menus in windows explorer[BETA]\r\n\r\n-Temporarily removed Preserve episode name functionality due to a massive bug\r\n\r\nV0.52b\r\n\r\n-Removed a nag screen caused by incorrect detection of season numbers\r\n\r\n-Improved aesthetics of default output format. The “s” denoting season and “e” denoting episode are now capital letters\r\n\r\n-Added support for .mov files\r\n\r\nV0.51b\r\n\r\n-fixed a bug where key numbers right at the end of a file name would crash the program\r\n\r\n-added support for .m4v and .flv files\r\n\r\n-fixed a bug where name detection would break when key numbers were missing\r\n\r\n-The file dialog now has “memory”\r\n\r\n-Both files and folders are now displayed in the file dialog. Selection of any file in a folder will tell the program to point to the parent folder of the file\r\n\r\nV0.5b\r\n\r\n-Improved program robustness when stray numbers are present in episode names\r\n\r\n-Added greater support for series that have no season numbers in their episode names\r\n\r\n-Improved program behaviour when dialog windows receive “cancel” responses\r\n\r\n-Preview frame is no longer resizable\r\n\r\n-The original file name is now shown when using the edit function of the preview window\r\n\r\n-Fixed strange behaviour with the panels in the preview window\r\n\r\n-Fixed preserve names functionality once again, still not ideal for HD series*\r\n\r\n-Program now automatically detects the name of the series\r\n\r\nV0.4b\r\n\r\n-beta release\r\n\r\n-restored preserve names functionality, optimised code slightly\r\n\r\nV0.34a\r\n\r\n-fixed a bug where video files without any numbers in their filename would break the program\r\n\r\n-fixed an issue where HD markers would be lost upon conversion\r\n\r\n-scrollbars in the preview window are now always synchronised\r\n\r\nV0.33a\r\n\r\n-fixed a bug where clicking cancel in the edit pane would corrupt the edited filename\r\n\r\nv0.32a\r\n\r\n-fixed a huge bug where misc. files that weren't at the end of the file list broke the program\r\n\r\n-cleaned up layout\r\n\r\n-created proper readme\r\n\r\nv0.31a\r\n\r\n-minor bug fixes\r\n\r\n-edit button added\r\n\r\nv0.3a\r\n\r\n-revisited project\r\n\r\n-added preview mode\r\n\r\nv0.21a\r\n\r\n-fixed a bug where misc. files in the folder would break the algorithm\r\n\r\nv0.2a\r\n\r\n-added option to retain file names\r\n\r\n-added basic support for HD, blu-ray and x264 formats\r\n\r\nv0.1a\r\n\r\n-initial release\r\n"}
